    <h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I began my coding journey in late 2020, when I realized that the skills I possessed in learning new languages could be 
    extended to learning how to write code. Eager to get started, I signed up for UC Berkeley Extension's Coding Boot Camp, where I 
    immediately got to work learning HTML and CSS. With these new skills, I hope to be able to support causes that are important to 
    me by creating or maintaining their websites and web applications, so that they can reach as many people as possible.
</p>
<p>On a personal note, I have a little coding buddy who's 5 months old, and enjoys grabbing my hair, trying to jump out of my arms,
    and chewing on things. My husband's a pretty cool guy, too.
